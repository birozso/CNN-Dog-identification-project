# CNN-Dog-identification-project
## Convolutional Neural Networks -  A complete Algorithm for a Dog Identification Application

This project is a part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree of Udacity.

The task descrioption and the part of the code came from the Udacity directly, the solutions / implementations - marked **DONE** - come from me.

## The project contains7 steps:

+ Step 0 : Importing datasets and manage human and dog files
+ Step 1 : Checking human face with OpenCV pre-trained face detector
+ Step 2 : Dog detection with VGG-16 model
+ Step 3 : Dog Breeds classification with CNN
+ Step 4 : Dog Breeds classification using Transfer Learning
+ Step 5 : Complete Algorithm for Human (dogbreed) and Dog detection
+ Step 6 : Test of the Complete Algorithm

Feel free to check my solution, but please do not copy it , as it is your task to solve the coding problems on your own.
